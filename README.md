# Swahili-Llama: A Conversation Large Language Model for Swahili Use Cases and RAG

## Description

To enhance the use of Large language models for Swahili content, We have created this repository, which aims to provide the code for Swahili-LLaMA - an LLM model based on the open-source LLaMA-2. Our approach includes expanding the vocabulary from the original 32K in LLaMA-2 to 49K in this initial version. We use LoRA for continued pretraining of the model, and the results in this current repository are at checkpoint 50% of 500M tokens based on LLaMA-2.  A comprehensive technical report and the final model at the 100% checkpoint—which promises even greater optimization—will be published shortly. This model demonstrates superior performance in Swahili text generation and is suitable for use with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks.
